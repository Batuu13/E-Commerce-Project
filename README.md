#E-Commerce Project

- A typical implementation of a e-commerce site. UI done with Twitter Bootstrap.
- Users can open an account and sell staff. 
- Users can open market for selling even more products. 
- Users can browse and search items with filter operations. 
- Users can message each other and get notifications. 

**Notice:** Some parts are still unimplemented or not finished. Feel free to contribute. Also most of the language is Turkish. This is because this is an old project of mine.
